        <h2>Do you need an immigration consultant or an immigration lawyer?</h2>
        <p>
          A common question when looking for an authorized representative is what sort of professional to hire - immigration consultants or lawyers? Generally speaking, if you want to know your immigration options or are looking to make an application (work permit, visitor visa, express entry, permanent residence, citizenship Canada, etc.) you need the services of a qualified immigration consultant. If you are in trouble with Canada immigration or looking to appeal a wrong decision, you need the services of a lawyer. In all cases, ensure the authorized representative that you choose to work with has training and experience in dealing with the type of application you need, or the immigration process that you find yourself in.
